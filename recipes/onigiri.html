        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Onigiri are Japanese rice balls made from cooked or steamed sushi rice, seasonings and fillings wrapped in a nori seaweed wrapper.</p>
        <p>Japanese people like to have home-made onigiri but they are also widely available in all kinds of convenience stores. 
            Today we are going to make a very simple version of onigiri that anyone can master.</p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Japanese short-grain rice or sushi rice</li>
            <li>Nori seaweed</li>
            <li>furikake (for seasoning)</li>
            <li>Fillings (optional)</li>

            <p> Fillings can be anythig of your choice. Some common ones include: <ul>
                <li>salted salmon or shake</li>
                <li>Japanese pickled plum</li>
                <li>tuna mayo</li>
                <li>okaka (bonito flakes moistened with soy sauce)</li>
                <li>tarako(salted cod roe)</li>
            </ul>
        My personal favorite is salted salmon.You can choose your own fillings.</p>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook the rice and transfer it to a baking sheet. Let cool just slightly. 
                The rice should be warm when you make onigiri.</li>     
            <li>Keep a bowl of water and a salt container near you. 
                Wet your hands and salt them. Rub your hands to spread the salt around.
                Salting will give the rice balls flavor and also preserve them for a longer time.</li>
            <li>Make a nice ball of rice. The size should be big enough but not too much so your hands cannot shape it.
                Make a hole in the centre and place your fillings in it. Then cover it up with the rice and keep shaping
                your rice ball. Give just enough pressure and rotate the rice ball while doing so.</li>
            <li>Wrap the rice ball with a sheet of nori seaweed and you're good to go!</li>
            <li>Lastly, remember to wrap the rice balls with a plastic wrap as the rice cand dry out otherwise.</li>        
        </ol>
